						Websites
					</h3>

					<p>
						In my spare time I built websites. I code most of my projects manually using a text-editor (Sublime Text). When I see that a project will get complex or if the client wants to make changes themselves I use a CMS (WordPress, OctoberCMS).

						Webapplications
					</h3>
					
					<p>
						I also try to put the focus on building webapplications. Right now I'm still learning languages like JAVA and C#. It takes some time because a lot of things are new to me, but I keep on practicing!

						Mobile Applications
					</h3>
					
					<p>
						Nowadays you can do pretty much anything with your smartphone. The possibilities are pretty much endless and that's what I see as a challenge!

						Webshops
					</h3>
					
					<p>
						Webshops are a true challenge when it comes to building and maintaining them. This requires neat coding, a lot of (technical) knowledge, client feedback and top notch security. This is what motivates me to learn and to get to know webshops better.
