						My name is Richinel Jarbandhan and I am a 22-year-old student. At the moment I am following the course of “Application Developer” at Albeda College in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I chose this course because I have been into computers pretty much my entire life. Since I was a child I was interested in computers and everything that had to do with them.

					<p>
						It all began with repairing computers and laptops from friends and/or family. I always wanted to know how everything works and that is how I got most of my knowledge about computers. I always experimented and did a lot of research myself. This is also the reason that I chose a course that suited my interests well. After high school I enrolled for the course of “Assistant IT Worker”. During this course I also had a subject that was called “Webdesign”. In this subject you basically learn how to create simple websites and you learn the basics of HTML and CSS. At first I really did not like this subject, because I had never coded before. But the more I tried to understand it, the more fun and interesting it got for me. This is why I chose the course of Application Developer.

						Below you can see what programming languages I learn and how experienced I am in them. HTML, CSS and Javascript are three languages that I pretty much taught myself. It was not that hard since they are pretty easy to learn. Right now I am focusing more on PHP and Java. PHP is not that hard either, but Java is a bit of a hassle for me. Iam starting to get the hang of it bit by bit, but it is difficult because it is such a wide and complex language. That it is a bit harder to learn is more fun for me, because I see it as a nice challenge and I love challenges and understanding new things (in this case, a new and big programming language).
